# Seam-Inc.
A web app developed using dot net architecture which primarily focuses on fuel conservation and pollution control in Lucknow.

The SEAM Inc. scooter pool system applies to most of the major cities of Lucknow and specifically looks into the subject of time management and pollution depending on a highly responsive backbone of information management. The efficiency of the request and the effectiveness with which the request is processed depend on what quality of information can be derived. 
In our city traffic has been a severe and even a lethal factor of “anti punctuality”. This has primarily been due to the fact that metro construction has resulted in partial and permanent closure of most of the roads. The major consequences have to be faced by the college students.

This project (currently) is focusing on our college i.e. National P.G. College as the students of our college are the ones who are currently facing the major part of the problem.

Seam Inc. primarily focus on this issues and help the students to reach their destination without hassles.
